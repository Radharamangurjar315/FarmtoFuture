## üß© API Endpoints  

### 1. **POST `/predict`**  
Predicts crop prices based on input parameters.  

#### Request Body  
```json  
{  
  "state": "Madhya Pradesh",  
  "district": "Indore",  
  "crop": "Wheat",  
  "date": "2024-12-31"  
}  
```  

#### Response  
```json  
{  
  "predicted_min_price": 2500,  
  "predicted_max_price": 2700  
}  
```  

#### Error Response  
```json  
{  
  "error": "Invalid input or server issue"  
}  
```

## üéØ How It Works  
1. The user selects the **state**, **district**, **crop**, and **date** through an interactive form.  
2. The frontend sends the data to the Flask backend via a POST request.  
3. The backend processes the input and queries a trained model to predict price ranges.  
4. The frontend displays the predicted minimum and maximum prices to the user.
